# Osteria: Restaurant Bot <br>

![Osteria](https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-5e071fb81310.gif)

Web application that enables a restaurant to receive orders via voice/text interface and interacts on behalf of the restaurant with its customers to 
take their orders using QR codes, React, nodeJS, DialogFlow and Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>
We offer two views: <br>
<li>For the customers where they can view the menu and interact with the DialogFlow agent (bot) to order food using voice and text based interface powered by AI.<br>
<li>For the admin where they can add and delete the menu items, view the employees and generate QR codes for their restaurant.
